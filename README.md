# IBS-DSA-project
This project demonstrates how to use De‚ÄØBruijn graphs for analyzing genome sequences and reconstructing possible paths representing the original genome. It combines concepts from Bioinformatics (for genome assembly) and Data Structures &amp; Algorithms (DSA) (for graph construction and traversal).

Viewers and users are encouraged to upload or search for your own dataset of genome fragments (e.g., sequencing reads) and modify the code accordingly to fit your project needs.
This keeps the project flexible and open-ended for different types of genomic data.


# üß¨ Genome Analysis and Path Reconstruction using De‚ÄØBruijn Graphs

This project shows how to:
- Build a **De‚ÄØBruijn graph** from genome fragments.
- Use graph traversal techniques to **reconstruct** possible genome paths.

It brings together:
- **Bioinformatics** concepts (genome assembly, k-mers)
- **DSA** techniques (graph representation and pathfinding)

##  How to use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the notebook `your_notebook_name.ipynb`.
3. **Upload your own dataset** of genome fragments or sequencing reads.
4. Modify the code to match your dataset‚Äôs format (if needed).
5. Run the notebook to build the De‚ÄØBruijn graph and explore reconstructed genome paths.

##  Dataset note
> The notebook currently does **not** include a dataset.  
> You can upload your own dataset (e.g., FASTA/FASTQ reads, or a simple list of k-mers) to experiment.
