# IBS-DSA-project
This project demonstrates how to use Deâ€¯Bruijn graphs for analyzing genome sequences and reconstructing possible paths representing the original genome. It combines concepts from Bioinformatics (for genome assembly) and Data Structures &amp; Algorithms (DSA) (for graph construction and traversal).
